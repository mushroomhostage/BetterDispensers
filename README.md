BetterDispensers - vertically-oriented dispensers and more!

With BetterDispensers you can:

* Place dispensers facing up or down (and they shoot projectiles up/down when activated)
* Activate dispensers when they are hit by arrows (optional)
* Add arrows to dispenser inventory when hit by arrows (optional)

## Usage

1. Look down or up and place a dispenser. 
2. Add projectiles (arrows, splash potions, eggs, snowballs) to the dispenser inventory.
3. Activate the dispenser, through redstone or shooting with an arrow

When placing the dispenser, you will receive a message saying what direction it is facing.
Projectiles from the dispenser will shoot in this direction.
