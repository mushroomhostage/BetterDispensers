BetterDispensers - vertical dispensers, automatic crafting, block breakers, conduits, and more!

With BetterDispensers you can:

* Place dispensers facing up or down (and they shoot projectiles up/down when activated)
* Activate dispensers when they are hit by arrows (optional)
* Add arrows to dispenser inventory when hit by arrows (optional)

## Basic Usage

***[Screenshots and tutorial](http://imgur.com/a/56DoO)***

1. Look down or up and place a dispenser
2. Add items (including projectiles) to the dispenser inventory
3. Activate the dispenser

When placing the dispenser, you will receive a message saying what direction it is facing.
Items dispensed from the dispenser will shoot in this direction.

## Advanced Usage



## Commands
"/dispenser [direction]" while looking at a dispenser lets you change or view its direction.
Requires betterdispensers.command permission.

## Permissions
betterdispensers.command (op): Allows you to use the /dispenser command

## Configuration


dispenseOnPlayerArrowHit (true): Activate dispensers when they are hit by normal player-shot or dispensed arrows.

dispenseOnOtherArrowHit (true): Activate dispensers when they are hit by other arrows, including those shot by skeletons or players with Infinity-enchanted bows.

acceptPlayerArrows (true): Add normal arrows shot by players (or dispensers) that hit dispensers to the dispenser inventory.

acceptOtherArrows (false): Add other arrows that hit dispensers to the dispenser inventory. This is false
by default since otherwise you can acquire arrows you normally cannot (those shot by skeletons or from Infinity-enchanted bows).
